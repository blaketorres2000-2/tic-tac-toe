# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

As a software developer, I strive to create engaging and interactive applications that enhance user experience. This project focuses on developing a simple yet addictive Tic Tac Toe game, allowing players to challenge each other or play against an AI opponent. The goal is to provide an intuitive interface for players while implementing core game mechanics.

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean design and responsive layout. Players can take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three in a rowâ€”either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This software aims to offer an enjoyable gameplay experience and help me further develop my front-end programming skills while applying best practices in web development.
